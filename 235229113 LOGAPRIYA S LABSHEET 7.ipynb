    "must be an __init__ method and you will need to store the data within the object.\n",

    "Question3. Create sub classes for Account class\n",
    "The aim of these exercises is to extend the Account class you have been developing from\n",
    "the last two chapters by providing DepositAccount, CurrentAccount and InvestmentAccount\n",
    "subclasses.\n",
    "Each of the classes should extend the Account class by:\n",
    " CurrentAccount adding an overdraft limit as well as redefining the withdraw\n",
    "method.\n",
    " DepositAccount by adding an interest rate.\n",
    " InvestmentAccount by adding an investment type attribute.\n",
    "These features are discussed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CurrentAccount class can have an overdraft_limit attribute. This can be set when an\n",
    "instance of a class is created and altered during the lifetime of the object. The overdraft\n",
    "limit should be included in the __str__() method used to convert the account into a string.\n",
    "The CurrentAccount withdraw() method should verify that the balance never goes below\n",
    "the overdraft limit. If it does then the withdraw() method should not reduce the balance\n",
    "instead it should print out a warning message.\n",
    "The DepositAccount should have an interest rate associated with it which is included when\n",
    "the account is converted to a string.\n",
    "The InvestmentAccount will have a investment_type attribute which can hold a string such\n",
    "as ‘safe’ or ‘high risk’.\n",
    "This also means that it is no longer necessary to pass the type of account as a parameter—it\n",
    "is implicit in the type of class being created.\n",
    "For example, given this code snippet:\n",
    "# CurrentAccount(account_number,account_holder,opening_balance,\n",
    "# overdraft_limit)\n",
    "acc1 = CurrentAccount('123', 'John', 10.05, 100.0)\n",
    "# DepositAccount(account_number, account_holder, opening_balance,\n",
    "# interest_rate)\n",
    "acc2 = DepositAccount('345', 'John', 23.55, 0.5)\n",
    "# InvestmentAccount(account_number, account_holder,opening_balance,\n",
    "# investment_type)\n",
    "acc3 = InvestmentAccount('567', 'Phoebe', 12.45, 'high risk')\n",
    "acc1.deposit(23.45)\n",
    "acc1.withdraw(12.33)\n",
    "print('balance:', acc1.get_balance())\n",
    "acc1.withdraw(300.00)\n",
    "print('balance:', acc1.get_balance())\n",
    "Then the output might be:\n",
